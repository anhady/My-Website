    <p>I went to Mauritus, Egypt, and South Africa. In Egypt I saw pyramids while riding camels, and in South Africa I went to Cape Town and I enjoyed seeing penguins and going on a safari and seeing all the African creatures. We spent a lot of time on the beach at Mauritus because it was an island. I enjoyed snorkeling there as well. </p>
